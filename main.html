  <h1>AUSTRALIAN LABOUR FORCE VISUALISATION</h1>
  <h2>How do employment and unemployment trends impact Australian industries and regions?</h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <div>
      <p>
        This set of visualisations provides a comprehensive overview of the Australian labor market, focusing on employment trends, gender distribution, industry analysis, and yearly changes in workforce participation. By leveraging various data visualization idioms, the insights presented here allow policymakers, researchers, and the general public to understand key labor market dynamics in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visualisations reveal patterns in gender distribution, industry-specific trends, employment growth over time, and how different regions contribute to the overall labor market. By combining data from various sources, this set of visualisations helps us understand the dynamics between economic policies, industry changes, and workforce participation. These insights are crucial for identifying workforce challenges, gender participation, and the impact of economic events on employment.

      <div class="annotation">
        <p><strong>Unemployment spike in 1982:</strong> Caused by the global recession and stagflation. Employment rose post-1983 as recovery policies were implemented.</p>

      <div class="description">
          <p>
            This visualization shows employment and unemployment trends from 1966 to 2001, segmented by gender.
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Female employment rises consistently over the period, while male unemployment experiences significant spikes, especially in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
            <strong>Policy Impact:</strong> Economic recovery policies post-1983 led to increases in employment, especially for women. This visualization provides a decade-spanning comparison between genders, offering valuable insights into the changing dynamics of the labor force over time.

      <h2>Employment Trends Across Australian States (January 2024)</h2>
      <div class="chart" id="choropleth_map"></div>
      <div class="description">
          <p>
            This choropleth map shows employment levels across Australia's states in January 2024. 
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Employment is concentrated in <strong>New South Wales</strong> and <strong>Victoria</strong>, which have the highest population and economic activity, while states like <strong>Tasmania</strong> and <strong>Northern Territory</strong> show significantly lower employment.
            <strong>Regional Influence:</strong> These differences are driven by factors such as regional economic activities, industry presence (e.g., mining in Western Australia), and population density.

      <div class="chart" id="bubble_chart"></div>
      <div class="description">
          <p>
            This bubble chart visualizes the relationship between <strong>median weekly earnings</strong> and <strong>workforce share</strong> across various industries. 
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Higher-paying industries like <strong>Mining</strong> and <strong>Financial Services</strong> employ fewer people, while industries with a larger workforce, such as <strong>Retail</strong> and <strong>Healthcare</strong>, tend to have lower average weekly earnings.
            <strong>Sectoral Trends:</strong> This reflects broader economic trends, where capital-intensive industries (e.g., mining) are highly productive but employ fewer people compared to labor-intensive industries like retail.

              This stacked bar chart compares <strong>female</strong> and <strong>male</strong> participation across various industries in Australia. 
              <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Industries such as <strong>Health Care and Social Assistance</strong> are dominated by women, while <strong>Construction</strong> and <strong>Mining</strong> are predominantly male-dominated. 
              <strong>Median Age:</strong> Younger industries (e.g., <strong>Retail</strong> and <strong>Hospitality</strong>) often have a higher share of part-time workers, and sectors with older median ages reflect more stable, full-time employment.

      <div class="description">
          <p>
            This visualization tracks the total number of hours worked and the yearly change in hours worked during 2024. 
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Fluctuations in total hours worked often correspond to seasonal employment changes or major economic events.
            <strong>Short-Term vs. Long-Term Trends:</strong> Short-term dips might be caused by temporary shocks (e.g., the holiday season), while the overall upward trend reflects a growing economy and increasing labor force participation.
