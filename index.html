                This set of visualisations provides a comprehensive overview of the Australian labor market, focusing on
                employment trends, gender distribution, industry analysis, and yearly changes in workforce
                participation. By leveraging various data visualization idioms, the insights presented here allow
                policymakers, researchers, and the general public to understand key labor market dynamics in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The visualisations reveal patterns in gender distribution, industry-specific trends, employment growth
                over time, and how different regions contribute to the overall labor market. By combining data from
                various sources, this set of visualisations helps us understand the dynamics between economic policies,
                industry changes, and workforce participation. These insights are crucial for identifying workforce
                challenges, gender participation, and the impact of economic events on employment.

                    This visualization shows employment and unemployment trends from 1966 to 2001, segmented by gender.
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Female employment rises consistently over the period, while male
                    unemployment experiences significant spikes, especially in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
                    <strong>Policy Impact:</strong> Economic recovery policies post-1983 led to increases in employment,
                    especially for women. This visualization provides a decade-spanning comparison between genders,
                    offering valuable insights into the changing dynamics of the labor force over time.

                    This choropleth map shows employment levels across Australia's states in January 2024.
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Employment is concentrated in <strong>New South Wales</strong> and
                    <strong>Victoria</strong>, which have the highest population and economic activity, while states
                    like <strong>Tasmania</strong> and <strong>Northern Territory</strong> show significantly lower
                    employment.
                    <strong>Regional Influence:</strong> These differences are driven by factors such as regional
                    economic activities, industry presence (e.g., mining in Western Australia), and population density.

                    This bubble chart visualizes the relationship between <strong>median weekly earnings</strong> and
                    <strong>workforce share</strong> across various industries.
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Higher-paying industries like <strong>Mining</strong> and
                    <strong>Financial Services</strong> employ fewer people, while industries with a larger workforce,
                    such as <strong>Retail</strong> and <strong>Healthcare</strong>, tend to have lower average weekly
                    earnings.
                    <strong>Sectoral Trends:</strong> This reflects broader economic trends, where capital-intensive
                    industries (e.g., mining) are highly productive but employ fewer people compared to labor-intensive
                    industries like retail.

                        This stacked bar chart compares <strong>female</strong> and <strong>male</strong> participation
                        across various industries in Australia.
                        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Industries such as <strong>Health Care and Social
                            Assistance</strong> are dominated by women, while <strong>Construction</strong> and
                        <strong>Mining</strong> are predominantly male-dominated.
                        <strong>Median Age:</strong> Younger industries (e.g., <strong>Retail</strong> and
                        <strong>Hospitality</strong>) often have a higher share of part-time workers, and sectors with
                        older median ages reflect more stable, full-time employment.

                    This visualization tracks the total number of hours worked and the yearly change in hours worked
                    during 2024.
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Fluctuations in total hours worked often correspond to seasonal
                    employment changes or major economic events.
                    <strong>Short-Term vs. Long-Term Trends:</strong> Short-term dips might be caused by temporary
                    shocks (e.g., the holiday season), while the overall upward trend reflects a growing economy and
                    increasing labor force participation.
